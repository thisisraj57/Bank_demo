**Class:** `Member`

**Description:**

The `Member` class is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that represents a member in a library management system. It has the following properties:

* `id`: The unique identifier of the member.
* `name`: The name of the member.
* `email`: The email address of the member.

**Annotations:**

* `@Id`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field is the primary key of the `Member` entity.
* `@GeneratedValue`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field should be automatically generated by the database.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to represent members in a library management system. You can create new `Member` objects, set their properties, and save them to the database. You can also retrieve `Member` objects from the database by their ID.

**Example:**

```java
Member member = new Member();
member.setName("John Doe");
member.setEmail("john.doe@example.com");

// Save the member to the database
entityManager.persist(member);
```

This code will create a new `Member` object and save it to the database. You can then retrieve the member from the database using its ID:

```java
Member member = entityManager.find(Member.class, 1L);
```

This code will retrieve the member with the ID of 1 from the database.
