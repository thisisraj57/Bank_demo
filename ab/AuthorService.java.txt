**Class:** `AuthorService`

**Description:**

The `AuthorService` class is a service class that provides methods for managing authors in a library management system. It uses the `AuthorRepository` to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

**Methods:**

* `getAllAuthors()`: This method retrieves all authors from the database.
* `getAuthorById(Long id)`: This method retrieves an author from the database by its ID.
* `createAuthor(Author author)`: This method creates a new author in the database.
* `updateAuthor(Author author)`: This method updates an existing author in the database.
* `deleteAuthor(Long id)`: This method deletes an author from the database by its ID.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to manage authors in a library management system. You can use the `getAllAuthors()` method to retrieve all authors from the database, the `getAuthorById(Long id)` method to retrieve an author by its ID, the `createAuthor(Author author)` method to create a new author, the `updateAuthor(Author author)` method to update an existing author, and the `deleteAuthor(Long id)` method to delete an author by its ID.

**Example:**

```java
AuthorService authorService = new AuthorService();

// Get all authors
List<Author> authors = authorService.getAllAuthors();

// Get an author by ID
Author author = authorService.getAuthorById(1L);

// Create a new author
Author newAuthor = new Author();
newAuthor.setName("Douglas Adams");
authorService.createAuthor(newAuthor);

// Update an author
author.setName("Douglas Adams (Updated)");
authorService.updateAuthor(author);

// Delete an author
authorService.deleteAuthor(1L);
```
