**Class:** `Book`

**Description:**

The `Book` class is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that represents a book in a library management system. It has the following properties:

* `id`: The unique identifier of the book.
* `title`: The title of the book.
* `author`: The author of the book.
* `category`: The category of the book (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, etc.).
* `quantity`: The number of copies of the book that are available in the library.

**Annotations:**

* `@Id`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field is the primary key of the `Book` entity.
* `@GeneratedValue`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field should be automatically generated by the database.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to represent books in a library management system. You can create new `Book` objects, set their properties, and save them to the database. You can also retrieve `Book` objects from the database by their ID.

**Example:**

```java
Book book = new Book();
book.setTitle("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy");
book.setAuthor("Douglas Adams");
book.setCategory("Science Fiction");
book.setQuantity(5);

// Save the book to the database
entityManager.persist(book);
```

This code will create a new `Book` object and save it to the database. You can then retrieve the book from the database using its ID:

```java
Book book = entityManager.find(Book.class, 1L);
```

This code will retrieve the book with the ID of 1 from the database.
