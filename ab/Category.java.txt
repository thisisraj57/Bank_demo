**Class:** `Category`

**Description:**

The `Category` class is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that represents a category in a library management system. It has the following properties:

* `id`: The unique identifier of the category.
* `name`: The name of the category.

**Annotations:**

* `@Id`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field is the primary key of the `Category` entity.
* `@GeneratedValue`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field should be automatically generated by the database.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to represent categories in a library management system. You can create new `Category` objects, set their properties, and save them to the database. You can also retrieve `Category` objects from the database by their ID.

**Example:**

```java
Category category = new Category();
category.setName("Fiction");

// Save the category to the database
entityManager.persist(category);
```

This code will create a new `Category` object and save it to the database. You can then retrieve the category from the database using its ID:

```java
Category category = entityManager.find(Category.class, 1L);
```

This code will retrieve the category with the ID of 1 from the database.
