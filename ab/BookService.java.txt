**Class:** `BookService`

**Description:**

The `BookService` class is a service class that provides methods for managing books in a library management system. It uses the `BookRepository` to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

**Methods:**

* `getAllBooks()`: This method retrieves all books from the database.
* `getBookById(Long id)`: This method retrieves a book from the database by its ID.
* `createBook(Book book)`: This method creates a new book in the database.
* `updateBook(Book book)`: This method updates an existing book in the database.
* `deleteBook(Long id)`: This method deletes a book from the database by its ID.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to manage books in a library management system. You can use the `getAllBooks()` method to retrieve all books from the database, the `getBookById(Long id)` method to retrieve a book by its ID, the `createBook(Book book)` method to create a new book, the `updateBook(Book book)` method to update an existing book, and the `deleteBook(Long id)` method to delete a book by its ID.

**Example:**

```java
BookService bookService = new BookService();

// Get all books
List<Book> books = bookService.getAllBooks();

// Get a book by ID
Book book = bookService.getBookById(1L);

// Create a new book
Book newBook = new Book();
newBook.setTitle("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy");
newBook.setAuthor("Douglas Adams");
newBook.setCategory("Fiction");
newBook.setQuantity(5);
bookService.createBook(newBook);

// Update a book
book.setTitle("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Revised Edition");
bookService.updateBook(book);

// Delete a book
bookService.deleteBook(1L);
```
