**Class:** `Review`

**Description:**

The `Review` class represents a review of a book in a library management system. It has the following properties:

* `id`: The unique identifier of the review.
* `bookId`: The ID of the book that was reviewed.
* `reviewText`: The text of the review.
* `rating`: The reviewer's rating of the book.

**Annotations:**

* `@Id`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field is the primary key of the `Review` entity.
* `@GeneratedValue`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field should be automatically generated by the database.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to represent reviews in a library management system. You can create new `Review` objects, set their properties, and save them to the database. You can also retrieve `Review` objects from the database by their ID.

**Example:**

```java
Review review = new Review();
review.setBookId(1L);
review.setReviewText("This book was great!");
review.setRating(5);

// Save the review to the database
entityManager.persist(review);
```

This code will create a new `Review` object and save it to the database. You can then retrieve the review from the database using its ID:

```java
Review review = entityManager.find(Review.class, 1L);
```

This code will retrieve the review with the ID of 1 from the database.
