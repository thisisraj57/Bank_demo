**Class:** `LibraryManagementApplication`

**Description:**

The `LibraryManagementApplication` class is the main entry point for a Spring Boot application that manages a library. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which indicates that it is a Spring Boot application.

**Method:**

* `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the main method of the application. It initializes the Spring application context and starts the application.

**Usage:**

To use this class, you can create a new Spring Boot project and add this code to the main class. Then, you can run the application using the `mvn spring-boot:run` command or by running the `main` method directly.

**Example:**

```java
public class LibraryManagementApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LibraryManagementApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

This code will create a Spring Boot application that manages a library. You can then add additional classes and components to the application to implement the specific functionality you need.
