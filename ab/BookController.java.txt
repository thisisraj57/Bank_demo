**Class:** `BookController`

**Description:**

The `BookController` class is a REST controller that provides endpoints for managing books in a library management system. It uses the `BookService` to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

**Methods:**

* `getAllBooks()`: This method retrieves all books from the database and returns them as a list.
* `getBookById(Long id)`: This method retrieves a book from the database by its ID and returns it.
* `createBook(Book book)`: This method creates a new book in the database and returns the created book.
* `updateBook(Long id, Book book)`: This method updates an existing book in the database and returns the updated book.
* `deleteBook(Long id)`: This method deletes a book from the database by its ID.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to manage books in a library management system through a REST API. You can use the `getAllBooks()` method to retrieve all books, the `getBookById(Long id)` method to retrieve a book by its ID, the `createBook(Book book)` method to create a new book, the `updateBook(Long id, Book book)` method to update an existing book, and the `deleteBook(Long id)` method to delete a book by its ID.

**Example:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/books")
public class BookController {

    @Autowired
    private BookService bookService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Book> getAllBooks() {
        return bookService.getAllBooks();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Book getBookById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return bookService.getBookById(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Book createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
        return bookService.createBook(book);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Book updateBook(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Book book) {
        return bookService.updateBook(book);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteBook(@PathVariable Long id) {
        bookService.deleteBook(id);
    }
}
```
