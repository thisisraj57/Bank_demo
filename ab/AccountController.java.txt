**Class:** AccountController

**Description:**

The AccountController class is a REST controller that handles HTTP requests for account management. It is annotated with @RestController and @RequestMapping("/api/accounts") which means that it handles HTTP requests to the "/api/accounts" URL.

**Methods:**

* **createAccount(Account account):** This method handles HTTP POST requests to the "/api/accounts" URL. It takes an Account object as input and saves it to the database. It returns the saved account.
* **getAccount(Long accountId):** This method handles HTTP GET requests to the "/api/accounts/{accountId}" URL. It takes an account ID as input and retrieves the account from the database. It returns the retrieved account.

**Explanation:**

The AccountController class is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to account management. The createAccount() method is used to create a new account, while the getAccount() method is used to retrieve an existing account.

**Example Usage:**

To create a new account, you can send an HTTP POST request to the "/api/accounts" URL with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

To retrieve an existing account, you can send an HTTP GET request to the "/api/accounts/{accountId}" URL, where `{accountId}` is the ID of the account you want to retrieve.
