**Class:** `Author`

**Description:**

The `Author` class is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that represents an author in a library management system. It has the following properties:

* `id`: The unique identifier of the author.
* `name`: The name of the author.

**Annotations:**

* `@Id`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field is the primary key of the `Author` entity.
* `@GeneratedValue`: This annotation indicates that the `id` field should be automatically generated by the database.

**Usage:**

You can use this class to represent authors in a library management system. You can create new `Author` objects, set their properties, and save them to the database. You can also retrieve `Author` objects from the database by their ID.

**Example:**

```java
Author author = new Author();
author.setName("Douglas Adams");

// Save the author to the database
entityManager.persist(author);
```

This code will create a new `Author` object and save it to the database. You can then retrieve the author from the database using its ID:

```java
Author author = entityManager.find(Author.class, 1L);
```

This code will retrieve the author with the ID of 1 from the database.
